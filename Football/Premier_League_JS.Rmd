Calculation of GPG (goals per game) averages for first 9 games and across the season for each team.

```{r}
# Install dplyr package
library("dplyr")
data = read.csv("results.csv", header =TRUE)
data = data %>% select(Season, DateTime, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG) %>% filter(Season == "2018-19")
home_goals = data %>% group_by(HomeTeam, Season) %>%
                summarise(total_home_goals = sum(FTHG), games_home = length(FTHG)) 
colnames(home_goals)[1] = "Team" 
away_goals = data %>% group_by(AwayTeam, Season) %>%
                summarize(total_away_goals = sum(FTAG), games_away = length(FTAG))
colnames(away_goals)[1] = "Team"
goals = merge(home_goals, away_goals)
goals = goals %>% group_by(Team) %>% select(Team, total_home_goals, total_away_goals, games_home, games_away) %>% summarise(goals = total_home_goals + total_away_goals, games = games_home + games_away)
goals_per_season = goals

#goals in early part of season, 2020/21
data = read.csv("results.csv", header =TRUE)
data[["DateTime"]] = as.Date(data[["DateTime"]])
data = data %>% select(Season, DateTime, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG) %>% filter(Season == "2018-19", DateTime <= "2018-10-22")
home_goals = data %>% group_by(HomeTeam, Season) %>%
                summarize(total_home_goals = sum(FTHG), games_home = length(FTHG))
colnames(home_goals)[1] = "Team" 
away_goals = data %>% group_by(AwayTeam, Season) %>%
                summarize(total_away_goals = sum(FTAG), games_away = length(FTAG))
colnames(away_goals)[1] = "Team"
goals = merge(home_goals, away_goals)
goals = goals %>% group_by(Team) %>% select(Team, total_home_goals, total_away_goals, games_home, games_away) %>% summarise(goals = total_home_goals + total_away_goals, games = games_home + games_away)
goals_first_part= goals
```

Now carry out James-Stein estimation.

Firstly I am assuming that each team's goal scoring rate, $X_i$ is distributed as follows $X_i \sim Poisson(\mu_i)$ where $\mu_i$ is the expected goals per game. Therefore across the first 9 matches $\sum_{i=1}^{9}X_i \sim Poisson(9\mu_i)$, which I can transform to become approximately normally distributed (Using Anscombe's transformation). The variance is approximately 1.


Using Anscombe's transformation.

```{r}
transformed = 2*sqrt(goals_first_part$goals +3/8)
transformed
```
Carry out original James Stein
```{r}
library(pracma)
JS_estimates <- (1-18/(Norm(transformed)^2))*transformed
JS_estimates <- (JS_estimates/2)^2-3/8
JS_estimates <- JS_estimates/9
```

Now carry out James Stein - adapted method
```{r}
adapted_JS_estimates <- mean(transformed) + (1-17/(Norm(transformed-mean(transformed))^2))*(transformed - mean(transformed))
adapted_JS_estimates <- (adapted_JS_estimates/2)^2-3/8
adapted_JS_estimates <- adapted_JS_estimates/9
```

Now compare with actual value, standard estimator and James Stein.

First calculate the risk from each.

```{r}
#MLE based SSE
Norm(goals_first_part$goals/9 -goals_per_season$goals/38)^2
#JS based SSE
Norm(JS_estimates - goals_per_season$goals/38)^2

Norm(adapted_JS_estimates - goals_per_season$goals/38)^2
#MC James-Stein plot

    lines(c((goals_per_season$goals/38)[i], (goals_first_part$goals/9)[i]), c(2,1))
}

for (i in 1:20){
    lines(c((goals_per_season$goals/38)[i], JS_estimates[i]), c(2,3))
    lines(c((goals_per_season$goals/38)[i], (goals_first_part$goals/9)[i]), c(2,1))

Compute limited translation estimator- and see if any improvement.
```{r}

limited_estimators <- mean(transformed) + (1-17/(Norm(transformed-mean(transformed))^2))*(transformed - mean(transformed))
for (i in 1:20){
  limited_estimators[i] = min(max(limited_estimators[i], transformed[i] -1),transformed[i] +1)
}
limited_estimators  <- (limited_estimators/2)^2-3/8
limited_estimators<- limited_estimators/9
Norm(goals_first_part$goals/9 -goals_per_season$goals/38)^2
Norm(limited_estimators - goals_per_season$goals/38)^2
plot(goals_per_season$goals/38, rep(2,20),  ylim = c(0.5,3.5), xlim = c(0,3), yaxt = "n", ylab =  '', xlab = "Estimates", col = "blue", pch = 15)
points(limited_estimators, rep(3,20), col = "blue", pch = 16)
points(goals_first_part$goals/9, rep(1,20), col = "blue", pch = 17)
sum(abs(limited_estimators - goals_per_season$goals/38 ) < abs(goals_first_part$goals/9 - goals_per_season$goals/38))
for (i in 1:20){
    lines(c((goals_per_season$goals/38)[i], limited_estimators[i]), c(2,3))
    lines(c((goals_per_season$goals/38)[i], (goals_first_part$goals/9)[i]), c(2,1))
