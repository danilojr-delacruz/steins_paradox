# Stein's Paradox

Stein's paradox was discovered by Charles Stein in 1956 and a complete constructive proof was provided by Stein and William James in their joint paper in 1961. 
The paradox arises in the simultaneous estimation of three or more parameters describing data drawn from independent distributions. Independence would lead us to believe that whether we estimate simultaneously or separately, the optimal way to do so would be the same. However, it turns out that when we are concerned with simultaneous estimation there are estimators which amalgamate the data and perform better than the estimator that arises when we estimate separately.
